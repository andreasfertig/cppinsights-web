      <h1>About</h1>

      <p><a href="/">C++ Insights</a> is a <a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>-based tool which
        does a source to source transformation. Its goal is to make things visible which normally, and intentionally,
        happen behind the scenes. It's about the magic the compiler does for us to make things work. Or looking through
        the classes of a compiler.</p>

      <p>Some time ago I started looking into some new things we got with C++11, C++14 and C++17. Amazing things like
        lambdas, range-based for-loops and structured bindings. I put it together in a talk. You can find the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://www.andreasfertig.info/talks_dl/afertig-ndcolo-2017-fast-and-small.pdf">slides</a> and a <a
            target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Bt7KzFxcbgc">video</a> online.</p>

      <p>However, all that research and some of my training and teaching got me start thinking how it would be, if we
        could see
        with the eyes of the compiler. Sure, there is an AST-dump at least for clang. With tools like <a target="_blank"
            href="https://godbolt.org/#">Compiler Explorer</a> we can see what code the compiler generates from a C++
        source snippet. However, what we see is assembler. Neither the AST nor the <a target="_blank" href="https://godbolt.org/#">Compiler
          Explorer</a> output is in the language I write code and therefore I'm most familiar with. Plus when teaching
        students C++ showing an AST and explaining that it is all there, was not quite satisfying for me.</p>

      <p>I started to write a <a target="_blank" href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a>-based tool able to transform
        a
        range-based for-loop into the compiler-internal version. Then, I did the same for structured bindings and
        lambdas. In the end, I ended up with doing a lot more as initially planned. It shows where operators are
        invoked,
        places in which the compiler does some casting. <a href="/">C++ Insights</a> is able to deduce the type behind
        <code>auto</code> or <code>decltype</code>. The goal is to produce compilable code. However, this is not
        possible
        in all places.</p>

      <p>Still, there is work to do.</p>

      <p>I do not claim to get all the things right. This is just the initial version of <a href="/">C++ Insights</a> I
        consider good enough to hand
        it to the public. Also, keep in mind that it is solely based on clang and my understanding of C++ and the AST.</p>

      <p>You can see, for example the transformation of a <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/f7710a4b">lamda</a>,
        <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/40f6a267">range-based
          for-loop</a> or <a href="https://cppinsights.io/s/e1a8cf40">auto</a>.
        Of course, you can transform any other C++ snippet.</p>
